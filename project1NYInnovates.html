						The first ever NY Innovates event – a New York State developer’s conference and health code-a-thon - kicked off December 17, 2013. The four-day event, held at RPI's Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) in Troy, was co-hosted by the NYS Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) and the NYS Department of Health. More than 250 attendees learned from the experiences of key leaders in the IT community representing private industry, academia, and public sector. A special part of the event was a 24-hour code-a-thon competition where programmers gathered to build solutions around the topic of diabetes prevention, using publically available health data.

						The first two days featured keynote speeches by industry leaders and hands-on learning sessions. The prevailing belief during the keynotes was that a “culture of innovation” was vital to any organization, even in government. Sinclair Schuller, CEO of Apprenda, stated any IT organization should aim to invest 70 percent of its resources on innovation and the rest for upkeep. He wasn’t the only one. There was a panel of entrepreneurs from start-up firms, moderated by Bela Musits from Union College. The panelists reinforced the importance of this concept, claiming a lack of innovation is a sure path to failure for either a start-up, or a full-fledged mature organization. Panelists boldly claimed to “fail often and early,” to learn from the mistakes in the innovation process, and to never make the same mistake twice.
					</p>
					<p>
						In between the big speeches were workshops for IT professionals who learned through hands-on training about new cutting-edge technologies and software development methodologies.  The topics were far-reaching and included insights into Big Data, Mobile Development, APIs, GitHub, User Experience, and Responsive Web Design. There were even topics on specific technologies such as Node.JS and Ruby on Rails. All focused on presenting the best practices of each technology, with a focus on the hands-on experience. The final two days of NY Innovates included health panel discussion and a health data code-a-thon. The two events ran in parallel. In fact, the programmers who were invited to the code-a-thon did not leave the building for almost 24 hours. The panel discussions focused on the current state of health and health data, while programmers worked nearby to design that vision.
					</p>
					<p>
						NY Innovates ended with the presentations by the code-a-thon teams. The prototype solutions ranged from desktop apps, to smartphone apps, to even a texting app and were judged by an expert panel of industry and academic professionals. A total of $10,000 in cash prizes was awarded to the top teams. NY Innovates instilled an energy of innovation and excited attendees to be creative and explore new technology. The event is over, but the impact will be seen throughout the IT community.
