							<p>
								Most people associate innovation with idea generation, however, true innovation is not only about generating ideas, but having a process for implementation.  NY State Innovation Network is a platform that enables the entire lifecycle of innovation – from ideation to execution.  Through a platform that integrates multiple public-private collaborative ecosystems, the Innovation Network strengthens local, regional and state economic viability, creates sustainable jobs, and support emerging entrepreneurial business.  The innovation network will provide an infrastructure to address society’s major problems in such areas as healthcare, transportation, education, and urban development.

							<p>
								This program defines an innovation framework – a structured process for aligning great ideas to managers and resources to implement them.   This framework is the based on the process of co-creation - summarized as a process of building new solutions with people, not for them.  Key to the process is involving people from inside and outside the organization.   This process enables building strong collaborative networks between people, ideas, and opportunities.  A citizen-centric approach provides greater assurance that we are focused on delivering solutions that will provide a real positive impact to people’s lives.

							<p>
								The primary objective of the next year is to deliver the NY State Innovation Network – an innovation ecosystem will enable State departments and agencies to more efficiently and effectively collaborate and work together to achieve the Governor’s call to harness the collective power of the State’s resources and capabilities.  
							</p>
							<p>
							The first year will focus on the next big innovation in transportation – the connected vehicle.  Connected vehicles refer to the suite of technology solutions that integrate communication technologies with transportation vehicles (passenger cars, rail systems, trucks, etc…) with infrastructure (car lanes, bridges, toll systems, etc…). This technology holds possibilities to alleviate many major problems, including improving safety, congestion, and fuel-efficiency.

								This report provides a look back at key innovative projects that were previously delivered by New York State Innovation Program. Although this document reflects on a small number of identified past accomplishments, innovation is an iterative, never-ending process.  New York State is committed to continuously improving on previous successes and identify new ideas and opportunities.
